# NVIDIATritonServer
The Triton Server is an NVIDIA Open Source project
that leverages cloud machine learning capabilities
through a server-side, client-side application framework. 
It allows for redundancy on the cloud node and 
propagation among client-side applications.

These are self-contained within Docker containers that provide
isolation, but multiple of the same machine learning 
model can be spawned for the purposes of high throughput 
operations.
